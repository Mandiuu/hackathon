**Know your roots**

When was the last time you discussed your family’s health history? While not common, it’s crucial to understand your roots for prevention and treatment. 
Living with a condition can feel isolating, but with Roots, you’re not alone. We’re building a genealogical health tree that ensures anonymity and privacy, 
so users feel safe sharing their health data while helping others with similar challenges. Roots empowers users to securely manage and share health information based on 
family relationships. With customizable privacy, users can track hereditary conditions, detect risks early, and maintain control over their sensitive data.
The platform offers private family chats and an anonymous forum for advice. Leveraging encryption and anonymization, Roots provides personalized healthcare insights for individuals,
families, and those seeking preventative health management
